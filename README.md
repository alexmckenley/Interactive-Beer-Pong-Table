Interactive-Beer-Pong-Table
===========================

Check out the fully functional table on youtube. 

The code in arduino/ is the program the monitors the sensors and controls the logic behind the color selection.

The eagle schematic diagrams can be found in the eagle/ direcory. 

I will upload more information when I get a change (or upon request).
